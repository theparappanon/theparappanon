Hello, and you can call me Nue or the PaRappanon.

I'm an open source enthusiast and while most of my work is now on GitLab or the parappa.party Gitea, I'm still on here in case I need to collaborate with GitHub projects or something.
I don't know, but aside from that I also like the original Playstation, PaRappa and Ape Escape.
