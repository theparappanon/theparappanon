hi there, and welcome to my special project corner of the internet.

i'm just some peruvian that spends way too much time in front of a screen. most of my
current work can be found on gitlab, but it is also here in order to promote it firther

i code a variety of stuff in a variety of languages, but currently focus on my parappa tts project.

my tools of the trade include arch linux, using the xfce desktop enviroment and neovim.

it's nice to meet you!
