Hello everyone.
I'm best known as the Parappanon, but if you think that's a mouthful then just call me Kenma instead.

I'm an open source enthusiast and while most of my work is now on GitLab or the parappa.party Gitea, I'm still on here in case I need to collaborate with GitHub projects or something.
I don't know, but aside from that I also like the original Playstation and Parappa.

### Tools of the Trade
- **Operating System:** Devuan GNU/Linux (testing/daedalus/ceres as of 2022-12-29)
- **Desktop Enviroment:** Xfce
- **Shell:** fish
- **Terminal Emulator:** Alacritty (Although I'd be using st instead if I was willing to go with the whole "you compile it again after you modify it" thing)
- **Text editor:** Neovim
- **IDE:** Haven't needed one yet, but when I did my earliest projects I was still on Windows and Visual Studio.
